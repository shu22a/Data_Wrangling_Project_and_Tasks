# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks
Repository for Data_Wrangling 181

This is a repository for all the projects done for the Data Wrangling class for the QBS program.

I, the author, have been given the permission to make my work public.

The midterm and final files contain assignments from the midterm and final exams. The rest contain class exercises and homework assignments where data wrangling was practiced with deidentified patient data.
